Install NVM (Node Version Manager)))
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

Use NVM to install the latest LTS version of Node.js (10.x.x as of this writing).
nvm install --lts

It is more secure to run apps without root privileges, so create a new user if necessary.

For production, to run node apps on port 80 (normally requires root privileges). Not needed for dev (with ports like 3000).
sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/local/bin/node

Install PM2 (Process Manager 2). PM2 is used to manage node processes (eg logging and restart when an app crashes).
npm i -g pm2
PM2 website: http://pm2.keymetrics.io/

Clone the git repo of the app you want to run, then cd app directory.

Install project dependencies.
npm i

Build the project if necessary (varies by project but typically `npm run build` is sufficient).

For React and other front-end-only apps you may need to install a basic web server.
npm i -g serve

Add the app to PM2. The file may not be named app.js. The entry point should be given in package.json > main or package.json > scripts > start.
pm2 start app.js

Check that you added the app correctly. You should be able to access the app and use the following command to see it in PM2.
pm2 list

A few more PM2 commands:
pm2 log          Tails logs from all running apps.
pm2 monit        Dashboard view of running apps.
pm2 restart 0    Restart app with ID 0 (run `pm2 list` to see the app IDs).
pm2 stop 0       Stop app with ID 0.
pm2 start 0      Start app with ID 0.
pm2 delete 0     Stop app with ID 0 and remove it from PM2.

Set up PM2 to start all the apps it manages automatically when the server reboots. Change USERNAME to the user that will be running the app.
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin pm2 startup -u USERNAME
